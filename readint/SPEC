Implement a function that reads in an integer from the user and returns 
it. 

The function should take one argument which is the prompt to display.

If the user input is not valid, that is, the input is not an integer, then
display an error message and ask the user again. The function should keep 
asking the user for an integer until a valid one has been entered.

Demonstrate use of the function by asking the user to enter an integer and
then echoing it to the terminal.
