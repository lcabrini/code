SPEC

Write a program that prints the following checkerboard pattern to standard
output:

* * * * * * * * 
 * * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * 
 * * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * *

 * * * * * * * * 

The program must use only three output statements, printing one of each of
the following strings:
1. "* "
2. " "
3. "\n"

NOTES

This is excercise 3.40 from C How to Program by Deitel & Deitel. I made a
slight modification to the text to not assume C as the implementation
language (the original text mentions printf).
