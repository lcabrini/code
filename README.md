# My Code Collection

This is my personal code collection. The kind of thing to throw at
recruitment zombies when they come asking for code samples. Hopefully,
finding the odd bits of Commodore 64 code will scare them off.

There are actually a few other reasons I keep it here. First of all, it's
just nice to have a collection of all these little programs that every 
programmer has written. I've lost so much code over the years and 
rewritten so many of these things over and over again.

Also, at my age, memory leaks get more common, so I may forget how to do
something simple. At such times, it can be nice to have a code collection
like this. Since I wrote all the code myself, at least I understand it.

Finally, I like to just write code. It doesn't always have to be part of
some big, complex project. Just like an athlete trains several hours a
day, so a programmer should write code every day. 

If you are looking at downloading this as some form of reference, then
you probably should rethink. You'd be better off writing your own code.
That way you build experience and you can organize it however it suits
you best.

That being said, if somebody out there in some way benefits from this
code, great!
 
## About the License

IANAL so I want a simple (non-viral) open source license for all my
projects. This used to be the BSD License, but the MIT license seems
more or less equivalent.

However, there is a question: can I license this code? Well, I don't know.
I don't think so, but I really don't know. Or care too much. None of the
code here is rocket science, it is the kind of stuff that every programmer
has written over and over again, before they could take on the title
programmer. 

Because of that, I consider that this is public, free-for-all knowledge,
that doesn't need to be licensed. However, if somebody who is a lawyer
contacts me and tells me I am doing something wrong, then I act on that. 
If that means turning the project private (I hate the idea of having to do
that), then so be it.
