The program should first print "Number of command-line arguments:" followed by the number of arguments passed in to the program. If the program did not receive any arguments, there should be no further output.

However, if the program got one or more arguments, each argument should be printed on a line, preceded by an index number. This index number should start at 1.

The program should then end successfully.
